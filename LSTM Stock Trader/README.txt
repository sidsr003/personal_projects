An LSTM based algorithmic high frequency trading system using a sequence model neural network to capture price movements, make accurate
predictions and execute trades in a position neutral strategy at the end. The algorithm executes buy/sell orders and squares off the orders
every subsequent timestep thereby mitigating large drawdowns and securing profits as soon as possible. Consistently generated stable monotonic returns on a range of stocks with very low variance.
