A mean-reversion based pairs trading statistical arbitrage strategy capable of generating substantial returns with zero starting investment.
Found highly correlated assets, performed OLS regression and identified stationarity via the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test at a statistically significant level. Modelled the distribution of the pair-spread as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process inspired by Brownian motion and solved the stochastic differntial equation to yield an AR(1) model. Then the spread's time series was autoregressed to determine coefficents up to lag 1 and the OU process parameters were estimated. Performed parametric bootstrapping with the obtained parameters by simulating and sampling from an OU process with the said parameters and re-estimating the parameters with AR(1) fitting to the generated series. Then the distribution of lag 1 autocorrelation half lives was studied to find an optimal lookback window. This window was used in rolling regression to trade the spread (long/short) at each timestep based on statistically significant z_scores. Achieved impressive returns with only a few drawdowns.
